/**
 * You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s
 * elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's
 * elements in the corresponding places of nums2.
 * 
 * The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to
 * its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. Output: [3,-1] Explanation: For
 * number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second
 * array is 3. For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number
 * for it in the second array, so output -1.
